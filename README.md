[//]: # (story of game)
## Story
---

What's a person to do when given superhuman strength?

Join a circus and show the world your superhuman strength by holding up heavy objects!

The secret to your power is that you can lift anything as long as you don't have too much weight on one side.

## How to Play
---

Place objects on the platform and try to avoid filling the gauge bar up either all the way to the left or right.

You can balance out the weight on one side by placing objects on the opposite side.

The goal is to try and keep the balance gauge from reaching the ends by balancing the weight on both sides of the platform.
